# 3. Exercise
This is a documentation for the thrid exercise from the subject I-PPDS.

For the third exercise I chose Producer-Consumer.

# 1. experiment
Settings:
-   Time to produce: n / x where n = 1-9 and x = 100
-   Tme to consume: randint(0, 10) / x where x = 100
-   Number of Consumers: 10
-   Number of Producers: 10
-   Storage size: 100

Graph:

If time to produce is increased so is number of products per second. While the number of consumers is increasing the number of products is increasing too so there is more products in storage then there is consumers.
