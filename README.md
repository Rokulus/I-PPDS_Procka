# 2. Exercise
This is a documentation for the second exercise from the subject I-PPDS. 

The base of my code is coming from seminar [2021-02 [seminár] Turniket, bariéra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIiHVcb3HqU&ab_channel=Paraleln%C3%A9programovanieadistribuovan%C3%A9syst%C3%A9my).

# Simple Barrier - 1. exercise
In the first exercise out task was to implement barrier according to the specification from the lecture [2022-02 [prednáška] Mutex, multiplex, rendezvous, bariéra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR5RWW1uj5g&ab_channel=Paraleln%C3%A9programovanieadistribuovan%C3%A9syst%C3%A9my).

At first we were tasked to use barrier. This is done in this [commit](https://github.com/Rokulus/I-PPDS_Procka/commit/00747b80d9ddcf7fad95cc89e74572f420f9ff57).
