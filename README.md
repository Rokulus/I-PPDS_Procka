# 6. Exercise
This is a documentation for the sixth exercise from the subject I-PPDS.


# Printout

We can see there are 5 customers always waiting. When new one comes, he automatically leaves because barber shop is full.

Barber and customer both print out that that they are doing something (either barber is doing
haircut or customer says he's finished). While they print out these messages another customers comes to the barber shop.

After customer with id 2 is finished the next one in line (in this case customer with id 0) is on the line to get a haircut.
